# unique-Long-To-unique-String-for-Java
your unique Long varible should in Ascii table,because my method is based on it, each word tanslate to a decimal, can also reverse it.  
example: String "aA1", a:97 A:65 1:49 ,then I add 0 in front of every decimal,result:097065049,if your decimal less than 10 ,you should add double 0.    
the reason I add 0 because I want reverse it , I just spilt it every three word.
